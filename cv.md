## About myself:
I got acquainted with the IT field in 2013 at the age of 20, then I took online courses and started working as a WEB designer. I am a creative person myself, so I wanted to realize myself in design. I was improving my skill and I liked it. But over time, I started to move towards Marketing. At first I promoted my clients' business, and then I started promoting my own projects. 

Thanks to the accumulated experience in Design and Marketing, in 2020 I launched my most serious project - a furniture store. Independently engaged in its promotion on the Internet, thanks to which he was able to quickly go into the plus and earn a good reputation with customers. Then I sold the business and moved to Austria.

Now I'm studying Front-End development at RSSchool!

## Code example:
```function peak(arr) {

  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    let leftSum = arr.slice(0, i).reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
    let rightSum = arr.slice(i + 1).reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
    if (leftSum === rightSum) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```
