## About myself:
I got acquainted with the IT field in 2013 at the age of 20, then I took online courses and started working as a WEB designer. I am a creative person myself, so I wanted to realize myself in design. I was improving my skill and I liked it. But over time, I started to move towards Marketing. At first I promoted my clients' business, and then I started promoting my own projects. 

Thanks to the accumulated experience in Design and Marketing, in 2020 I launched my most serious project - a furniture store. Independently engaged in its promotion on the Internet, thanks to which he was able to quickly go into the plus and earn a good reputation with customers. Then I sold the business and moved to Austria.

Now I'm studying Front-End development at RSSchool!

## Code example:
```function fizzbuzz(n)
{
  let ar = [];
  for ( let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if ( (i % 3 === 0) && (i % 5 === 0)) {
      ar.push('FizzBuzz');
    }
    else if ( i % 3 === 0 ) {
      ar.push("Fizz");
    }
    else if ( i % 5 === 0) {
      ar.push("Buzz");
    }
    else {
      ar.push(i);
    }
  }
  return ar;
}
```
